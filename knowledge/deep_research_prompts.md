## 1. Color Theory / Seasonal Color Analysis

Research color theory for personal styling. I need a comprehensive, detailed report (2500-3500 words) covering:

1. **The Seasonal Color Analysis System** — the original 4-season model (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter), how it evolved into the 12-season system (Light/Warm/Bright Spring, Light/Cool/Soft Summer, Soft/Warm/Deep Autumn, Deep/Cool/Bright Winter), and the emerging 16-season system. Explain the three dimensions: undertone (warm vs cool), value (light vs deep), and chroma (bright/clear vs soft/muted)

2. **Each of the 12 Seasons in Detail** — for each season: the defining characteristics (undertone + value + chroma combination), specific color names that work best (not just "blues" but "dusty rose, sage green, soft teal"), and colors to avoid. Cover: Light Spring, Warm Spring, Bright Spring, Light Summer, Cool Summer, Soft Summer, Soft Autumn, Warm Autumn, Deep Autumn, Deep Winter, Cool Winter, Bright Winter

3. **How to Identify Your Undertone** — the vein test (blue/purple = cool, green = warm), the jewelry test (silver vs gold), the white vs cream test, the draping method. Practical, actionable advice someone can do at home

4. **Applying Color Theory to Clothing** — how to build outfits within your palette, what happens when you wear out-of-palette colors (washed out, harsh, unflattering), how to use neutrals strategically within your season, the concept of "borrowing" from adjacent seasons

5. **Color Combinations for Outfits** — complementary colors (opposite on color wheel), analogous colors (adjacent), triadic combinations, monochromatic dressing (different shades of same color), how to use accent colors

Use authoritative sources (The Concept Wardrobe, Color Me Beautiful, Gabrielle Arruda, etc.). Clear H2 headers. Information-dense and actionable. No fluff.

## 2. Body Shapes & Proportions

Research body shape styling for personal fashion. I need a comprehensive, detailed report (2500-3500 words) covering:

1. **The Major Body Shape Categories** — inverted triangle (broad shoulders, narrow hips), rectangle (balanced but straight), hourglass (balanced with defined waist), triangle/pear (narrow shoulders, wider hips), apple/round (carries weight in midsection). For each: defining physical characteristics, what creates visual balance, common misconceptions

2. **Dressing Strategies for Each Shape** — for each body type: specific garment recommendations (necklines, sleeve styles, pant cuts, skirt lengths, jacket styles), what to emphasize vs minimize, fabric choices that work best. Be specific: "V-necklines elongate the torso" not just "choose flattering necklines"

3. **Petite Styling** — specific challenges (proportions look different at smaller scale), strategies that work (monochromatic dressing, vertical lines, proper hem lengths, scale of prints/patterns), common mistakes to avoid

4. **General Proportion & Balance Principles** — the rule of thirds, how vertical vs horizontal lines affect perception, the power of the "third piece" (jacket/vest/scarf), tucking strategies (full tuck, half tuck, French tuck), how layering affects proportions, the role of color in creating visual balance, monochromatic elongation effect

Use authoritative sources (Gabrielle Arruda, The Concept Wardrobe, style professionals). Clear H2 headers. Practical, actionable advice. No body-shaming language — frame as "creating your preferred silhouette." No fluff.

5. **Natural/Relaxed Archetype** — defining characteristics (effortless, casual, organic), key pieces (relaxed-fit jeans, linen shirts, comfortable knits), fabrics (cotton, linen, denim), color palette (earth tones, muted greens), daily incorporation

6. **Creative/Artsy Archetype** — defining characteristics (eclectic, experimental, pattern-mixing), key pieces (unique prints, vintage finds, asymmetrical cuts), approach to color and pattern

7. **Modern Aesthetic Trends** — map these to the classic archetypes:
   - Quiet Luxury / Old Money (maps to Classic)
   - Dark Academia (maps to Classic + Dramatic)
   - Coastal Grandmother (maps to Natural + Classic)
   - Cottagecore (maps to Romantic + Natural)
   - Minimalist / Scandinavian (maps to Classic + Natural)

   For each: defining characteristics, key pieces, typical palette

## 4. Occasion Dressing & Dress Codes

Research modern dress codes and occasion-appropriate dressing. I need a comprehensive, detailed report (2500-3500 words) covering:

1. **Business Casual (2025-2026)** — how it has evolved (no longer just "khakis and polo"), current interpretation (tailored jeans acceptable, sneakers can work, blazer optional but elevating), industry variations (tech vs finance vs creative), specific outfit formulas for men and women

2. **Smart Casual** — how it differs from business casual (slightly more relaxed, personality-forward), the "dark jeans rule" (dark denim as the foundation), layering strategies, shoe choices that define the tone, specific examples

3. **Business Professional / Business Formal** — the modern suit (fit matters more than brand), acceptable color palettes, shirt/blouse options, shoe requirements, accessory guidelines, gender-inclusive approaches

4. **Formal / Black Tie / White Tie** — the actual rules (not just "wear a suit"), black tie specifics (tuxedo requirements, dress length, fabric expectations), white tie (the most formal), cocktail attire (the versatile middle ground), semi-formal guidance

5. **Date Night Dressing** — psychology of first impressions through clothing, confidence-boosting outfit strategies, venue-appropriate choices (casual coffee vs nice restaurant vs activity date), balancing personality expression with occasion appropriateness

6. **Casual Everyday** — elevated casual (how to look put-together in "casual" clothes), the concept of "one level up" dressing, weekend outfit formulas, athleisure done right vs wrong

7. **Seasonal & Weather Considerations** — how to maintain style in extreme weather (layering for cold, breathable fabrics for heat), transitional dressing (spring/fall), rain-appropriate outfits that still look good

## 5. Wardrobe Building & Capsule Wardrobes

1. **What is a Capsule Wardrobe** — the philosophy (fewer, better pieces that all work together), history of the concept, why it works (decision fatigue reduction, cost efficiency, sustainability), common misconceptions

4. **Building Around a Color Palette** — base colors (neutrals that form 70% of wardrobe), accent colors (20%), statement pieces (10%), how to choose your base neutrals (black-based vs brown-based vs navy-based), warm palette vs cool palette wardrobes, the concept of a "color story"

5. **Mix-and-Match Strategies** — how to maximize outfit combinations from minimal pieces (the multiplication effect), the concept of "third piece" dressing (top + bottom + jacket/scarf/vest), creating outfits formula (neutral base + accent + texture mix)

6. **Seasonal Wardrobe Rotation** — how to rotate pieces seasonally, storage strategies, transitional pieces that work across seasons, the concept of a "year-round core" vs "seasonal additions"
